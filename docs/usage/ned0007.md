# NED0007: Missing Authors Configuration

## Overview

**Severity**: Warning  
**Category**: Package Metadata  
**Applies To**: Packable Projects

## Description

The project file is missing or has an incomplete configuration for the `<Authors />` property. This property identifies the individuals or organizations responsible for creating and maintaining the package. Proper author attribution provides credit, establishes accountability, and helps users contact the maintainers.

## Impact

- No clear identification of package maintainers or authors
- Users cannot identify who to contact with questions or issues
- Reduced professional appearance and credibility
- Missing attribution for contributors
- Poor community recognition and trust

## Resolution

### Step 1: Open Your Project File

Locate and open your project file (`.csproj`, `.fsproj`, or `.vbproj`).

### Step 2: Add or Update the Authors Property

Ensure the `<Authors />` property is present in your project's `<PropertyGroup>` section. Multiple authors can be separated by semicolons:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <Authors>Author Name;Another Author</Authors>
  <!-- Additional properties -->
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Step 3: Validate and Rebuild

Validate your project file for syntax errors and rebuild your project:

```bash
dotnet build
```

## Best Practices

- List primary authors and major contributors
- Use full names for clarity and professionalism
- Include organizational names when representing a company or project
- Separate multiple authors with semicolons
- Ensure accuracy of names and attributions
- Consider adding contact information via email or GitHub profiles
- Update author lists as team membership changes

## Example

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <PackageId>NetEvolve.Defaults</PackageId>
    <Title>NetEvolve Build Defaults and Configuration</Title>
    <Authors>Daily DevOps Team;NetEvolve Contributors</Authors>
    <Company>Daily DevOps</Company>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
