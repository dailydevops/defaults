# NED0009: Missing Copyright Year Start Configuration

## Overview

**Severity**: Warning  
**Category**: Package Metadata  
**Applies To**: Packable Projects

## Description

The project file is missing or has an incomplete configuration for the `<CopyrightYearStart />` property. This property specifies the year when copyright for the project began, establishing the timeline of intellectual property rights. Proper copyright dating is important for legal clarity and demonstrates professional package management.

## Impact

- Incomplete copyright information in package metadata
- Legal ambiguity regarding intellectual property rights timeline
- Missing context for copyright year ranges
- Reduced professional appearance in package metadata

## Resolution

### Step 1: Open Your Project File

Locate and open your project file (`.csproj`, `.fsproj`, or `.vbproj`).

### Step 2: Add or Update the CopyrightYearStart Property

Ensure the `<CopyrightYearStart />` property is present in your project's `<PropertyGroup>` section. Use the year when the project was first created or released:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <CopyrightYearStart>2021</CopyrightYearStart>
  <!-- Additional properties -->
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Step 3: Validate and Rebuild

Validate your project file for syntax errors and rebuild your project:

```bash
dotnet build
```

## Best Practices

- Use the year when the project was first created or initially released
- Ensure the year is accurate and reflects the project's actual timeline
- Use a 4-digit year format (YYYY)
- Include copyright year information in the `<Copyright />` property as well
- Update copyright notices annually if required by your legal team
- Consider using a copyright notice pattern like: `Copyright (c) 2021-2025 Company Name`

## Example

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <PackageId>NetEvolve.Defaults</PackageId>
    <Title>NetEvolve Build Defaults and Configuration</Title>
    <Company>Daily DevOps</Company>
    <CopyrightYearStart>2021</CopyrightYearStart>
    <Copyright>Copyright (c) 2021-2025 Daily DevOps. All rights reserved.</Copyright>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
