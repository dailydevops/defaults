# NED0003: Missing Package Description Configuration

## Overview

**Severity**: Warning  
**Category**: Package Metadata  
**Applies To**: Packable Projects

## Description

The project file is missing or has an incomplete configuration for the <Description /> property. This property provides a detailed overview of your NuGet package's functionality and purpose. A comprehensive description is essential for helping potential users understand what your package does and whether it meets their needs.

## Impact

- Users cannot understand the package's purpose and functionality
- Reduced adoption due to unclear value proposition
- Poor search results on NuGet.org
- Potential for misuse or confusion about the package's capabilities

## Resolution

### Step 1: Open Your Project File

Locate and open your project file (.csproj, .fsproj, or .vbproj).

### Step 2: Add or Update the Description Property

Ensure the <Description /> property is present in your project's <PropertyGroup> section. Write a clear, comprehensive description:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <Description>A detailed description of your package's functionality and benefits.</Description>
  <!-- Additional properties -->
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Step 3: Validate and Rebuild

Validate your project file for syntax errors and rebuild your project:

```bash
dotnet build
```

## Best Practices

- Write a clear, concise description (1-2 sentences, up to 500 characters)
- Explain what the package does and what problems it solves
- Include key features or capabilities when relevant
- Use plain language appropriate for your target audience
- Avoid marketing hype; focus on technical accuracy
- Ensure the description complements the title without being redundant

## Example

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <PackageId>NetEvolve.Defaults</PackageId>
    <Title>NetEvolve Build Defaults and Configuration</Title>
    <Description>Comprehensive build automation and configuration package providing centralized MSBuild properties, standardized code analysis rules, and enterprise-grade development standards for consistent project setup across the NetEvolve ecosystem.</Description>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
