# Compiler Warning NED0004

The project file is missing or has an incomplete configuration for the `<PackageTags />` tag. This tag is essential for categorizing your package and improving its discoverability in package repositories. Without a properly configured `<PackageTags />`, users may find it challenging to locate your project, which can impact its adoption and usage.

To resolve this issue, please follow these steps:

- Open the Project File: Locate and open your project file (e.g., `.csproj` for C# projects).

- Add or Update the `<PackageTags />` Tag: Ensure that the `<PackageTags />` tag is present and correctly formatted.

  It should look like this:
  ```xml
  <PackageTags>your;tags;here</PackageTags>
  ```

- Validate the Configuration: After making changes, validate the project file to ensure there are no syntax errors.

- Rebuild the Project: Once the configuration is corrected, rebuild your project to confirm that the issue is resolved.

If you continue to experience problems, consider checking the documentation for your specific project type or reaching out to your development team for further assistance. Proper configuration of the `<PackageTags />` tag is essential for enhancing the visibility and accessibility of your project.
