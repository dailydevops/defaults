# NED0002: Missing Package Title Configuration

## Overview

**Severity**: Warning  
**Category**: Package Metadata  
**Applies To**: Packable Projects

## Description

The project file is missing or has an incomplete configuration for the `<Title />` property. This property defines the display name of your NuGet package as it appears on NuGet.org and in package management tools. A clear, descriptive title is essential for user discoverability and package recognition.

## Impact

- Package displays with a generic or missing name on NuGet.org
- Reduced visibility and discoverability for potential users
- Professional appearance is compromised
- Users cannot quickly understand the package's purpose

## Resolution

### Step 1: Open Your Project File

Locate and open your project file (`.csproj`, `.fsproj`, or `.vbproj`).

### Step 2: Add or Update the Title Property

Ensure the `<Title />` property is present in your project's `<PropertyGroup>` section. Use a human-readable, descriptive title:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <Title>Your Package Display Name</Title>
  <!-- Additional properties -->
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Step 3: Validate and Rebuild

Validate your project file for syntax errors and rebuild your project:

```bash
dotnet build
```

## Best Practices

- Use a clear, descriptive title that reflects the package's purpose
- Keep the title concise (under 100 characters)
- Use sentence case or PascalCase, consistent with your branding
- Include the key functionality or domain in the title
- Ensure the title is different from and more readable than the `<PackageId />`

## Example

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <PackageId>NetEvolve.Defaults</PackageId>
    <Title>NetEvolve Build Defaults and Configuration</Title>
    <Description>Enterprise-grade build configuration and standards package</Description>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
