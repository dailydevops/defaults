# NED0008: Missing Company Configuration

## Overview

**Severity**: Warning  
**Category**: Package Metadata  
**Applies To**: Packable Projects

## Description

The project file is missing or has an incomplete configuration for the `<Company />` property. This property identifies the organization or company responsible for developing and maintaining the package. Clear company attribution establishes organizational responsibility and helps users understand the package's origin and support.

## Impact

- No clear organizational ownership or branding
- Reduced trust and credibility in the package
- Users cannot identify who provides support and maintenance
- Missing organizational context for related packages
- Poor professional appearance

## Resolution

### Step 1: Open Your Project File

Locate and open your project file (`.csproj`, `.fsproj`, or `.vbproj`).

### Step 2: Add or Update the Company Property

Ensure the `<Company />` property is present in your project's `<PropertyGroup>` section:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <Company>Your Company Name</Company>
  <!-- Additional properties -->
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Step 3: Validate and Rebuild

Validate your project file for syntax errors and rebuild your project:

```bash
dotnet build
```

## Best Practices

- Use the official company or organization name
- Ensure consistency across all your packages
- Include the company name in the package copyright notice
- Use the legal company name for formal attribution
- For open-source projects, use the project organization name
- Keep the company name stable to maintain brand recognition

## Example

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <PackageId>NetEvolve.Defaults</PackageId>
    <Title>NetEvolve Build Defaults and Configuration</Title>
    <Authors>Daily DevOps Team</Authors>
    <Company>Daily DevOps</Company>
    <Copyright>Copyright (c) Daily DevOps. All rights reserved.</Copyright>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
