## Project configuration warning NED0002

The project file is missing or has an incomplete configuration for the `<Title />` tag. This tag is essential as it defines the display name of your project, which is used in various contexts, including package management and user interfaces. An incomplete or absent `<Title />` can lead to confusion during deployment and may affect how users perceive your project.

To resolve this issue, please follow these steps:

- Open the Project File: Locate and open your project file (e.g., `.csproj` for C# projects).

- Add or Update the `<Title />` Tag: Ensure that the `<Title />` tag is present and correctly formatted.

  It should look like this:
  ```xml
  <Title>Your Project Title</Title>
  ```

- Validate the Configuration: After making changes, validate the project file to ensure there are no syntax errors.

- Rebuild the Project: Once the configuration is corrected, rebuild your project to confirm that the issue is resolved.

If you continue to experience problems, consider checking the documentation for your specific project type or reaching out to your development team for further assistance. Proper configuration of the `<Title />` tag is essential for maintaining a smooth development workflow.
